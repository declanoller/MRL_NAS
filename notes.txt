--method with chopping up array into sections actually probably won't work:
    -for example, that means you can't do a softmax on it (because you need 3 of the entries
    to end up as 1)
    -you could instead make it a Q value network, but that would change a lot of fundamental stuff I think

--Instead, I can think of two options:
    -similar to how pi and V are separately, have pi_parent, pi_child, pi_choice, probably simple?
    -can have the same architecture if you're willing to have N_max_atoms**2 * N_choices outputs for
    pi... so like 500 for even a pretty small one
      -on the other hand, it's possible that having several linear layers is actually worse somehow?
